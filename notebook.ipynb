While acceptable for most cache scenarios, a motivated attacker can craft two different payloads that map to the same cache key. If that risk matters in your environment, supply a stronger encoder (e.g. SHA‑256 or BLAKE2) via the `key_encoder` argument. If you change the key encoder, consider also creating a new cache, to avoid (the potential for) collisions with existing keys.\n",

       "'Victory Mansions is a building where Winston Smith resides in the novel \"1984.\" It is a run-down apartment complex located in Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania. The hallway of Victory Mansions smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The building has a faulty lift and Winston often has to climb seven flights of stairs to reach his flat. Inside the flat, there is a telescreen, which is a device that continuously broadcasts propaganda and can never be fully turned off. The neighborhood surrounding Victory Mansions is depicted as grimy, with dilapidated buildings and bombed sites. The overall atmosphere of Victory Mansions reflects the oppressive and austere setting of the dystopian society depicted in the novel.'"
