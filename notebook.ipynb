       "AIMessage(content='These are all classic Indian dishes that can easily be made vegetarian with a few ingredient swaps. Here are some alternatives for the non-vegetarian ingredients:\\n\\n1. Butter Chicken: Substitute the chicken with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) or tofu. Marinate the paneer or tofu in a mixture of yogurt and spices before cooking it in the creamy tomato and butter sauce.\\n\\n2. Chana Masala: This dish is already vegetarian! Just make sure to use vegetable oil instead of ghee for a vegan version.\\n\\n3. Palak Paneer: Replace the paneer with tofu or boiled and cubed potatoes for a similar texture. You can also use cashew cream or coconut milk to make the curry creamy.\\n\\n4. Biryani: Skip the meat and add more vegetables like carrots, peas, and potatoes. You can also use soy chunks or tofu for a protein boost.\\n\\n5. Aloo Gobi: This dish is naturally vegetarian! Just make sure to use vegan butter or oil instead of ghee.\\n\\n6. Dal Tadka: Use vegetable oil instead of ghee for tempering the lentils. You can also add coconut milk or cashew cream for a creamy texture.\\n\\nThese substitutions will help you create delicious vegetarian versions of these traditional Indian dishes without compromising on flavor. Enjoy cooking!')"
